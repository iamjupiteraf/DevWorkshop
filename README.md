I kept having errors on my terminal saying Authentification Failed and it wouldn't let me commit changes from my terminal. To fix this error, I tried using a token to authenticate instead of my username and password but that didn't work either. I tried committing my changes directly through GitHub, but I'm not sure if they stayed because it deleted my hello.py twice the first couple of times I tried to commit changes. I ended up refreshing and recommitting my changes through the GitHub website itself.
